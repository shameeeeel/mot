            <p><i>How long has it been since when we started talking? Can you still remember it? Of how our love story goes to where we are today.
                I guess time move too fast, yeah? I still remember when we were too shy to look to each other's eyes lol.
                And now we've celebrated our 8th monthsary together. <br><br>I guess I'm still lucky afterallâ€”'cause I've been through a lot of struggles
                in my life and almost ended it, but here you are, someone who showed me the wonder of life. That no matter how cruel living is,
                there's still a lot of reason to keep going forward. Sometimes, I ask myself, what kind of person I am if I didn't meet you.
                And then I realize somethingâ€”you're the solely reason why I am here today. That if not because of you, I'm probably not be here. <br><br>
                God crosses our path 'cause he knows we need each other. Me who will be your helping hand, and you who gives me a reason
                to keep living. God saw all the sacrifices you've made. All of your hardworks. Those days where you're too tired. Those days
                where you cry silently. Those days where you chose to hurt yourself instead of talking back. God saw it all.
                I am sure that God's happy right now, 'cause despite all the struggles that you've encountered, you still chose to keep living even though
                you don't open up your problems to others.<br><br>Therefore, God let us meet. So whenever you need someone to talk to, you go to me. And when
                I need a reason to keep living, I think of you. I love you, langgg. I'm sorry if I'm not able to spoil you right now. Unta mo stay gihapon kas akoa bisag
                wala pa koy mahatag karon nimoa. Happy 8th monthsary po! &#160;-hirang</i></p>
